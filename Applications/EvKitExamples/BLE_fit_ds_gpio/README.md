## Application description

The BLE\_fit\_ds\_gpio application demonstrates how to use the low power modes of ME14 to reduce the power consumption of the BLE\_fit example while simultaneously handling GPIO interrupts. This application functions the same as the BLE\_fit application aside from using the low power modes and adding the ability to wake from a GPIO interrupt.
